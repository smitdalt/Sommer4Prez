                  As your MSB class president. I will strive to accurately and fairly represent all MSB students. 
                  I believe that I have already shown my qualities as a leader through sharing helpful resources and my willingness to engage with all classmates. 
                  Additionally, I know I can be a successful president, as I have plenty of leadership experience. 
                  At my undergraduate school, I was the head of the committee to plan the largest student involvement event, with an attendance of over 7,000 students annually. 
                  On top of that, I was the president of the Red Cross Club at my undergrad, overseeing all events and club coordination for over 200 members. 
                  In these roles, among many others, I have had the chance to speak with authority figures and crowds as large as 10,000, making me very comfortable with speaking in different settings. 
                  Finally, I have already established a rapport with many faculty and staff, as well as many classmates. 
                  As a result of all these experiences, I know I can be a successful president and work to make our experience at ACHE even better!
